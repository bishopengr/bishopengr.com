Land development, whether it is commercial, residential, municipal, or a combination of these, requires thorough site analysis. A lead civil engineer will work closely with the land developer to provide the design the client wants while ensuring the site follows the regulations and requirements of the governing cities and counties. Bishop Engineering’s civil engineering team is well-suited to handle public relations as well as interactions with governmental agencies. Land development is scrutinized by environmental and citizen groups as well, and Bishop will make sure the project is in full compliance with all environmental permitting. Our projects are led by an experienced civil engineer who guarantees our land development jobs are successfully completed in a timely manner, without costly delays, and to the satisfaction of our clients.

**Subdivision of Land**

Bishop Engineering has a long history of residential and commercial subdivisions in the Central Iowa area. We are very familiar with the local jurisdictions’ policies and procedures for the development and design of such projects. A subdivision development begins with a concept plan that the client and Bishop Engineering develop in cooperation.  
Bishop Engineering then presents the concept plan to the governing body for review and comment. We work with the local government to develop a plan that meets the client’s needs as well as conforms to the community’s comprehensive plan for development. Once a preliminary plat is approved, Bishop Engineering develops detailed plans for the construction of the subdivision including, but not limited to, grading, paving and utilities. Utilities include sanitary sewer, storm sewer, water main and the services for each individual lot. We will also apply for all of the necessary permits, including Department of Natural Resources and Department of Transportation.  
Our experienced field technicians will ensure that the construction process remains in accordance with the plans. We are responsible for the construction staking including grading, paving, utilities and survey monuments. After the construction phase is complete, a final plat will be developed by a licensed professional land surveyor. The final plat will indicate the lot number, area of the lot, address of the lot, dimensions of the lot, building setbacks and easement on the lot.  
Our field technicians will place monuments at the corners of each lot within the subdivision. Once the subdivision plat is approved and acknowledged by the governing body, Bishop Engineering will record the plat with the County in which the subdivision lies. The client will receive copies of the recorded subdivision plat. Bishop Engineering will keep the plat on file in the company archives and additional copies will be available to the client upon request.
