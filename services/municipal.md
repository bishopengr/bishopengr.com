**Public Improvement Projects**

Closely associated with private development projects, improvements to public facilities are often driven by development and re-development of commercial and residential areas. In fact, most of the streets, sidewalks, sewers and water mains designed by Bishop Engineering are ultimately turned over to the cities of the communities in which we work. Bishop Engineering has also contracted directly with local governments to design collector and arterial street projects among other improvement initiatives. Our engineering and design staff are intimately familiar with the Statewide Urban Design and Specification Standards adopted by most cities, and the Iowa Department of Natural Resources design standards and permitting processes. Several of our designers have experience preparing roadway and drainage plans for the Iowa Department of Transportation and are very familiar with their Design and Construction Specifications and processes as well.
