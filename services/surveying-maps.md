**Boundary Surveys**

Bishop Engineering performs boundary surveys in accordance with the Administrative Rules Governing Land Surveying in the State of Iowa. First, we research the record for applicable deeds of the property and its adjoiners. Using this information, we also search our own extensive data base for existing surveys of the area to be examined. The professional land surveyor assigned to the job will then prepare a contract detailing the estimated cost and work schedule for the project before field work begins.

Our field technicians will search for monuments pertaining to the boundary and its adjoiners to establish boundary control and find, or place, monuments at the property corners. A “plat of survey” drawing will be developed detailing the procedures used to perform the survey. The plat will be submitted to the governing body responsible for approving the survey, and we ensure that it will meet any and all requirements of the local jurisdiction and/or applicable laws.

Once the plat of survey is approved and acknowledged by the governing body, Bishop Engineering will record the plat with the county in which the survey lies. Our client will receive three copies of the recorded survey plat. We will keep the survey plat on file in the company archives and additional copies will be available to the client upon request.

**Boundary Surveys**

An American Land Title Association (ALTA) survey is usually requested for large commercial transactions where the mortgage institution requires a survey of the property in which they will be holding interest. It is the most in-depth type of survey we perform.

On a typical ALTA survey, the boundary is established per the deeded description and all improvements on the property, and within the adjoining street right of ways, are located (this includes, but is not limited to; buildings, streets, parking areas, walkways, and visible evidence of utilities). Topography is not usually shown on an ALTA survey but is occasionally requested. The survey will illustrate the type of building and its use. The current zoning for the property will be determined, and if the property conforms to these requirements it will be so noted on the survey. This would include items like building setbacks, building heights, and number of parking stalls. The flood zone as designated by the FEMA flood insurance program is researched and shown as well.

The surveyor must examine the current title commitment and include any items that are listed as “schedule B exceptions” in the survey drawing. These are generally easements that both benefit and burden the property. The drawing will also show encroachments on boundary lines and easement lines. The surveyor then certifies to the client, the title company, and the lender that they can rely on the survey as accurate evidence of the site’s conditions at the time the assessment was made.
